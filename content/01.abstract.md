## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Foundation models are increasingly used across biomedical domains, including clinical text, medical imaging, genomics, and protein modeling. At the same time, rapidly advancing general-purpose foundation models can often be adapted to biomedical tasks through prompting, fine-tuning, and tool use. This raises a central question: **do biomedical applications require domain-specific foundation models, or can general models be adapted effectively?**

In this review, we examine the landscape of biomedical foundation models and compare domain-specific pretraining with adaptation of general models. We discuss how these approaches interact with biomedical data systems and the challenges of evaluation, reliability, and deployment. We conclude by outlining key open problems that will shape the future of foundation models in biomedical research and healthcare.
